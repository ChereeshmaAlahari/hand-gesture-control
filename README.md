Hand Gesture-Controlled System for PC Interaction
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, Pycaw
Tools: Webcam, Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction

Developed a real-time computer interaction system using hand gestures captured via webcam, enabling touchless control of core system functions. Integrated computer vision techniques and hand landmark tracking to recognize gestures and trigger corresponding actions.

Key Features:

Controlled mouse cursor movement and clicks using finger positions.

Navigated presentation slides (next/previous) with specific gestures.

Adjusted system volume using thumb-up/down gestures.

Closed browser tabs with hand signs simulating keyboard shortcuts.

Triggered system shutdown using a defined static gesture.

Highlights:

Utilized MediaPipe for precise hand tracking and landmark extraction.

Applied PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse and keyboard events.

Designed an intuitive gesture recognition model based on finger state logic.

Created a user-friendly and responsive system with minimal latency.
