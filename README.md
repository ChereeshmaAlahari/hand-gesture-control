Hand Gesture-Controlled System for PC Interaction
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, PyAutoGUI, Pycaw
Tools: Webcam, Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction

Developed a real-time, touchless interface using hand gestures to control essential PC functions, enhancing accessibility and interactivity.

Key Features:

Mouse control: Moved cursor and simulated clicks using finger tracking.

Slide navigation: Swiped to change presentation slides with two- or three-finger gestures.

Volume control: Raised or lowered system volume using thumb-based gestures.

Zoom control: Pinch gestures used to zoom in/out on web pages, images, or applications.

Close tab: Used palm or “cut” gesture to simulate Ctrl+W to close browser tabs.


Highlights:

Implemented gesture recognition logic based on real-time hand landmark data from MediaPipe.

Enabled seamless interaction using PyAutoGUI for simulating OS-level input.

Designed with a focus on low latency, accuracy, and intuitive user experience.
